# Noted
By: Dasyel Willems <dasyelwillems@hotmail.com>  

An android app to make notes. Notes are saved automatically on changing activities and/or closing the app.
Each note needs a unique name/title, but don't worry to much about this because the app will add numbers to your name (windows style) if you pick an existing name.
Long press on a note in the overview to delete it.
